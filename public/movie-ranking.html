    <h2>My Top 3 Movies</h2>

        <li><strong>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World</strong></li>

            <p>Very geeky, millennial-coded, but I still love it. To this day, I still put it on as background noise.</p>
        <li><strong>The Shawshank Redemption</strong></li>

            <p>I know, it's a cliche that every guy loves either <em>Goodfellas</em>, <em>Fight Club</em>, or this movie. It really is a great movie though.</p>
         <li><strong>A Christmas Story</strong></li>
            <img src="../assets/images/christmas-story-poster.jpg" width="200" alt="A Christmas Story movie poster" />
            <p>I love a good coming-of-age story. Combine that with the wit of Jean Shepherd, who wrote the book the film is based on, <em>In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash</em>, as well as narrates the film, and you have a perfect Christmas movie.</em></p>
